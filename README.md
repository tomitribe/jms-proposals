# jms-proposals

The purpose of this project is to gather ideas for evolving JMS beyond Java Message Service 2.0 within the Jakarta EE Working Group at Eclipse. This project is open to anyone to submit ideas and discuss or comment on the ideas of others. Please be sure that you are proposing original ideas or that you give credit for concepts you did not invent.

This is the first step in forming the JMS Specification Project and ensuring the process is open to everyone who is interested and that all ideas as to the future evolution of JMS receive an equal voice.  

Please feel free to add your own module to the project and to express your ideas. Take a look at some of the existing proposals to get an idea of the structure of your own contribution. Ideally, every proposal will have a readme, a POM, and sample code that compiles.  

We welcome all kinds of proposals and they need not be completely flushed out at first.  What is important is that your proposal is easy to understand and, where possible, provides code examples.  The scope of the proposals will range from slight API changes to wholesale expansion or modification of JMS.

We look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your ideas for the future of JMS.
