/**
 * This annotation designates a callback method on a JMS message-driven bean that will receive messages from a topic,
 * and specifies the topic from which messages will be received.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default a non-durable subscription is used. The {@code DurableSubscription} annotation may be used in conjunction
 * with this annotation to specify that a durable subscription is required.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation may only be used if the JMS message-driven bean implements the {@code JMSMessageDrivenBean} marker
 * interface and does not implement the {@code MessageListener} interface. If this annotation is used on a
 * message-driven bean that implements the {@code MessageListener} interface then deployment will fail.

 * Only one method may be designated as a callback method. If more than one method on a JMS message-driven bean is
 * annotated with {@code QueueListener} or {@code TopicListener} then deployment will fail.
